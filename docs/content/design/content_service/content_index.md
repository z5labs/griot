The Content Index is a quick and simple indexing of the individual pieces of content.
It's primary purpose is to help avoid the need to scan [Content Storage]({{% ref "/design/content_service/content_storage" %}})
when the user wants to list out all of their content. This is typically going to provide
lower level functionality for higher-level user experiences like curating content into
[Collections]({{% ref "/user_guide/curating_content#collection" %}}) and/or [Libraries]({{% ref "/user_guide/curating_content#library" %}}).
